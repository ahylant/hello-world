# hello-world
my first repository created in github. it will be a location for all of my potential project ideas and brainstorming.

My name is Andrea. I am obsessed with coffee (it's even my favorite Ice Cream Flavor). I'm from Ohio. If I were an animal, I'd probably be a Moose. It's not a glamorous animal, but I have to tell it like it is. Someday, I'd love to spend a month backpacking in Patagonia.
